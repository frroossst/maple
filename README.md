# Maple 🍁

A minimal, simple math markup language that compiles to HTML, written in Rust 


# Motivations

- **Simple:** Natural Language alternative to math markup like LaTeX

- **Portable:** Plain text files and compiles to HTML

- **Verbose:** Typing speed is not a concern which enables expressive and flexible syntax
  
- **Minimal:** Limited features (more to be added as I need them)

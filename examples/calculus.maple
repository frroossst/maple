# Sample

This is a random collections of formulas and notes from my class to test out how
the language syntax should be.


# Vectors

let icap = cap("i")
let O = [0, 0, 0]
symbol r

Suppose vec!(r) is the vector from O to (x, y, z), then we can write in vector form

let vec!(r) = icap(i) + jcap(y) + kcap

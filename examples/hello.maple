### Quadratic formula

This is **very** important

Italics font is *slanted*

It was not discovered by this guy! He was busy making cups?!
![Pythagoras](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.historycollection.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F07%2F38cross-section-of-a-pythagorean-cup.-pintrest.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=747723f73a2e6b2aca85a6433a4b20116cedde41676f964c0012d49c0c960636&ipo=images)

```
x = 123
y = 123
```

// this does not appear in the final document

> Let there be hypotenuse

let x = 123;
let y = integral(
    0, 10, 
    "x^2", 
    "dx"
);
let z = dot(
    vec(1, 2, 3), 
    vec(4, 5, 6)) 
    * 10;

let a = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9;
let b = (a * 10) * 10;

integral of x^2 from 0 to 10 w.r.t x can be written as

fmt(integral(0, 10, "x^2", "dx")) or fmt(y)

# This is where the maple üçÅ magic ‚ú® begins! 

fmt(icap() + jcap() + kcap()) is the sam;e as fmt(icap()) + fmt(jcap()) + fmt(kcap()) 

fmt(icap())     // prints the math
fmt(icap)       // prints the defined value of icap
fmt("icap")     // prints the string "icap"
"fmt("noshow")" // does nothing

fmt(integral(0, 10,"x^2" , "dx"))

THIS IS THE END!
